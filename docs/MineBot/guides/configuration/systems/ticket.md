# Ticket System

Welcome to the ticket system guide for `MineBot`. 

Here, you'll learn how to set up, configure, and use the ticket system to manage reports, tickets and questions efficiently.

- [Click here for example config](../../../examples/configuration/systems/ticket.md)

## <u>Ticket Systems</u>
There are 2 systems for tickets:

### 1. Thread
- This is a new system that MineBot uses to open subheadings on a single channel.

### 2. Category
- This system opens different channels on a category. This is an older system preferred by some networks. 

=== "Thread"
    ```markdown
    ticket_system: Thread
    ```
=== "Category"
    ```markdown
    ticket_system: Category
    ```

## <u>Opening Styles</u>
We have 2 opening styles:

### Direct
- Does not send any information message to the channel you set as the main channel, you must either send this message yourself or write it in the channel description.
- Direct opening style can only be used in message and command opening methods and **is not** compatible with other systems.

### Post Message
- It sends an embed information message to the channel you set as the main channel. Thus, you do not need to send any information message.
- Post Message opening style is compatible with **all opening methods**.

=== "Direct"
    ```markdown
    opening:
      style: Direct
    ```
=== "Post Message"
    ```markdown
    opening:
      style: Post Message
      message_channel: 1275571829657833584
    ```

## <u>Opening Methods</u>
We have 5 different opening methods in this area:

### Message
- This opening method creates a ticket channel when a message arrives in the channel you specified for the ticket category.
- Assigns the message it receives as an embed message into the ticket channel it opens.

### Reaction
- This opening method is triggered when there is a reaction to the information message on the channel you set as the main channel.
- Different emojis can be defined for all ticket categories you specify.
- Also receives information about the ticket content from the user via a form.

### Button
- This opening method defines different buttons to the information message in the channel you set as the main channel and tickets in different categories can be opened through these buttons.
- It is possible to assign different buttons for each ticket category.
- Each button has an emoji and text that can be determined for itself.
- It receives information messages for Ticket from the user via the form.

### Dropdown
- This opening method uses discord's dropdown system and turns all ticket categories into a selectable dropdown and opens a channel in the selected category.
- Each category has an emoji and text that can be determined for itself.
- It receives information messages for Ticket from the user via the form.

### Command
- This opening method defines a command using the discord application command system and opens ticket channels through this command.
- It receives information messages for Ticket from the user via the form.
