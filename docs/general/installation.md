## Detailed Installation Process

### Step 1: Download Your Plugin

After purchasing a plugin from BuiltByBit.com (we only sell there), download the latest version of the plugin JAR file.

### Step 2: Place the File

Copy the downloaded JAR file into your Minecraft server's `plugins/` folder.

### Step 3: Restart Your Server

Stop your server completely using the `stop` command.

::: warning IMPORTANT - AVOID /RELOAD
Never use `/reload` or plugin managers like PlugMan for installation or updates. These tools can cause data loss and unexpected behavior.

Always perform a complete server shutdown and restart when installing or updating plugins.
:::

### Step 4: Verify Installation

After your server starts up, you can verify that the plugin installed correctly by:

1. Check the console for startup messages like these:

   ```
   [ChatControl] Loaded!
   ```

2. Check that the plugin appears green in `/plugins` command.

3. Run the primary command for your plugin:

   | Plugin | Primary Command |
   |--------|----------------|
   | ChatControl | `/chatcontrol` or `/chc` |
   | Boss | `/boss` |
   | CoreArena | `/corearena` |
   | Protect | `/protect` |
   | Winter | `/winter` |

### Step 5: Initial Configuration

Most MineAcademy plugins feature initial setup assistants:

- **ChatControl** offers a quick start tour: `/chc tour`
- **Boss, CoreArena, Protect, Winter and others** automatically create configuration files you can edit

::: tip Command Shortcuts

You can use Bukkit's `commands.yml` file to create shortcuts for any plugin command.

Here is an example of creating a custom `/snow` command that will execute `/winter snow`.

```yaml
aliases:
  snow:
  - winter snow
```
