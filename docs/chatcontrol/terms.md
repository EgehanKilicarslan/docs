# Terms of Service

::: danger
ðŸ”´ PLEASE READ IN FULL. IT WILL SAVE YOUR SERVER AND YOUR NERVES. ðŸ”´
:::

By using MineAcademy or kangarko's Products, you are agreeing and acknowledging that you have read and understood to the following terms and conditions.

::: warning
You will find the unlock command above by reading the terms in full.
:::

## 1. Distribution of paid products is not allowed

You are not allowed to distribute the product outside your Minecraft server or a Network. 

This applies both to the binaries or any sources. 

Illegal distribution will lead to legal action. 

::: warning
You can decompile our plugins to learn but you cannot copy paste or use our code in plugins you publish online.
:::

## 2. Support is only given to paid customers and only on GitHub.

If you have not purchased ChatControl, you are not entitled to support.

::: warning
Discord is for volunteer-based support only.

To contact our developers, report bugs, you need to open a ticket on Github.
:::

You must be a buyer and able to produce evidence upon request to receive support. 

For pre-sale questions, see the link below for contact.

## 3. Please use "/chc tour" and read the docs before asking questions

You can save days waiting for your reply by spending 3 minutes reading [docs.mineacademy.org](https:://docs.mineacademy.org). 

::: warning
Because I'm mostly developing ChatControl alone, answering tickets may take 0-5 business days.
:::

I don't sell ChatControl for business purposes but as a hobby. To accept that, type `/chc tour confirm` in game.

::: warning
NB: On older ChatControl versions, you additionally need to type "/chc tour mothman".
:::

## 4. Usage on multiple networks/servers

You may use our products freely on 1 network you own for commercial, and non-commercial purposes.

If you operate multiple, separated networks (i.e. not one Velocity cluster), contact us for a multi-license discount.

You may also use our products for testing purposes on your local test server.

## 5. Refunds

In exceptional circumstances we issue refunds 30 days of purchase. Such as when you use ChatControl on a heavily customized network and find it incompatible. 

Contact us (see the link at the bottom) for assistance first.

No refunds are given in case of abusive treatment of our support team, opening 1* reviews without attempting to resolve the issue with us first or violating the rules on this page.
