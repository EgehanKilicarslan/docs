## How to Use Commands

To use commands, simply execute them in your console or the in-game chat. Many commands support additional parameters, see below.

<div class="command-notation">

* **[]** = optional arguments (use only one at once, or one + reason when muting or clearing the chat)
* **&lt;&gt;** = required arguments

</div>

::: tip
The short variant for **/chatcontrol** is **/chc** and **/ch** for **/channel** You can change those commands in settings.yml by finding Command_Aliases keys.

To see more on how commands works and how it can be used, simply hover your mouse over it and additional information will follow.

<div class="commands-section">

### `/chc announce`
Send any message to everyone on your server or network. You can send a chat message, title, boss bar, action bar, toast or even json.

### `/chc book`
Create a custom book. You can then read this book by yourself or for other players, using this command, or in chat formatting such as: "Click [here] to read server rules." or in [Rules](./rules).

### `/chc clear`
Clear the game chat. You can specify the parameters -a for anonymous clearance (hides who cleared it) or -s to avoid announcing anything. Proxy is supported. You can also give a clear reason.

### `/chc color`
Set yourself a custom chat color and decoration. You can set this via command for yourself or other players or via a GUI menu. For Minecraft 1.16+ we support RGB color codes using HEX such as "#CCDD99".

### `/chc debug`
If you want to report a bug, run this command. It will compile all files into a single ZIP file that you can then upload to GitHub when creating an Issue. We remove your MySQL password and other sensitive data.

### `/chc forward`
Send any command to be executed on proxy or even on another server. Make sure that you give yourself the "chatcontrol.command.forward" permission on proxy also.

### `/chc info`
Utility command to view player nicks, view saved player data, parse variables to test them or view if player is a newcomer. Newly connected players can have different rules such as longer antispam delays, see [Newcomer](./newcomer).

### `/chc log`
Discover what happened in game such as player messages, commands, what books were written, what mails were sent, what private messages were exchanged and much more. With a powerful filtering such as "/chc log all by:kangarko in:1h".

### `/chc message`
Manipulate player join, quit, death messages or with timed message broadcasts without leaving the game.

### `/chc permissions`
View all permissions the plugin has, what permissions you have and what are given by default.

### `/chc points`
Manipulate player warning points. Players can receive punishment points for doing certain things such as spamming or cursing (configurable). We execute certain actions such as mute/kick when they exceed a certain amount of points. Points can be grouped into sets such as "light-swears", "hard-swears", "spam" etc.

### `/chc purge`
Remove all messages from a player, even if he disconnected after writing them. Proxy is supported.

### `/chc region`
Place 3D regions in the world you can then use in rules using the "require region" or "ignore region" operators, see [Rules](./rules). For example, you can make stricter antispam in your spawn area. Or you can write a rule that completely prevents writing something in your PvP arenas.

### `/chc reload`
Reloads the plugin and its configuration. Some things by their nature, such as listener priorities, console filtering etc. cannot be reloaded. PlugMan is unsupported and may break. Please only use /chc reload and restart as soon as possible.

### `/chc rule`
Add, import, list, reload or toggle chat filters. A filter, called a rule, is a simple way to catch ANYTHING in your chat, commands, signs, items, books or even server packets and execute actions on it. Such as by typing "apple" player receives a warning. This is used against spam, swears, ads, also to stop bots, or even creating entire help systems, chat bots or new plugin commands (like Skript). See [Rules](./rules).

### `/chc tag`
Admin command for setting custom nick, prefix or suffix for players. Proxy is supported. You can also list offline players' nicks, prefixes and suffixes!

### `/chc tour`
A quick tour on getting started with ChatControl, or migrating from a previous version.

### `/chc migrate`
Scans all files and converts ChatControl 10 syntax to 11. This command won't change legacy &c colors to mini &lt;red&gt; tags. Legacy colors are still supported in ChatControl 11. It will only do these things:

* Replace %syntax% placeholders to {syntax}
* Replace `&#000000` hex and `#000000` variables to `&lt;#000000&gt;` MiniMessage format.
* Replace §x§0§0§0§0§0§0 to MiniMessage as well (very few people used this format).
