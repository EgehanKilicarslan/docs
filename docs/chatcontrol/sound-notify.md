# Sound Notify

We can allow players to mention others in the chat: "Hello @kangarko!" and play a sound to the player who is mentioned.

You can specify the cooldown between each mention, the sound and the color. You can also restrict this feature only if the player is afk, or prefixed with a certain string like "@".
