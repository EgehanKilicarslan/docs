CoreArena can automatically refill all chests within your arena's region on certain phases, or on every Nth phase.

## Setting up

::: tip Easy Setup
All you have to do is place the desired items into all chests and then save the region as the Initial Snapshot in the arena menu. The chest content will be stored in the snapshot and used to refill the chests automatically.
