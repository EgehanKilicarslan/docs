Wouldn't it be fun if you could spawn your bosses where you want, and how you want it? That's why we added a special feature named Spawner Eggs, which allows you to summon Bosses easily.

## Obtaining a Spawner Egg
You can obtain a spawner egg in the /boss menu or via /boss get command.

## Air Spawn
This is a special function allowing you to spawn mobs in the distance out of your reach, which means that you can right click with the spawner egg blocks far away, or even air, and the Boss will be spawned there!
