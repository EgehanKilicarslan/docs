## Supported Plugins
* **WorldGuard** Is compatible, and you can set the 'boss-target' flag to false to stop Bosses automatically targeting players inside regions.
* **Pets and stacking plugins** may cause issues with Boss, contact their dev team to add exception for us. See [Common Issues](common-issues) for more information.
* **MythicMobs** and Boss are mutually compatible as long as you don't try turning a Boss from our plugin into a MythicMob and applying both plugins on the same entity.
