# Customizing Bosses

![Customizing Banner](https://i.imgur.com/5ZMI9Lb.png)

Making your Boss is only tied to your creativity. Using the Bossâ„¢ plugin you'll be able to adjust almost any behavior Minecraft naturally provides. However, we currently don't offer custom mob behavior and things alike due to the fact these access NMS (internal server classes) and are proven unstable, breaking heavily with each MC release.

To configure your boss, click on his spawning egg in the /boss menu --> Bosses.

There you will see the main configuration for your boss. You can also open the same menu by right clicking a Boss Spawner Egg in your hands.

## Some requested settings

We will limit this page to only show settings people are asking us.

### Display Name / No AI / Gravity / Baby / other flags

You can enable/disable advanced flags like these (and much more) in Settings --> Specific Settings menu.

::: warning
**IMPORTANT** Old Minecraft versions, especially 1.8.8, lack majority of these settings due to lacking APIs.

### Making Boss invulnerable

Use Specific Settings from the menu above to toggle this option. If your Minecraft version does not offer it, you must change the Boss's health to a very high value.
