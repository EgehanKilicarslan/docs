## Minecraft Version

You can run **Bans** on the following Minecraft versions below. Please note that the `x` stands for any sub-version, for example, 1.21 or 1.21.3.

> Many issues are often caused by incompatible other plugins and not by your Minecraft version. Make sure all dependencies are up-to-date. We reserve the right to close tickets with startup log with errors from other plugins since they might interfere.
