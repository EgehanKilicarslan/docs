- To get the token, visit the Discord Developer Portal.
- For more information, see [Installation](../installation/index.md)

### Default Guild
- Default guild is the id of the main server you will use the bot on.

### Database

- You can tell us which provider you are using in the database.provider section.
=== ":simple-mongodb: MongoDB"
    1. **Collection**: On MongoDB, you can write whatever you want the name of the collection in the cluster to be.
    2. **URI**: The URI we need to connect to your MongoDB database.
=== ":simple-sqlite: SqLite"
    - There is no extra key you need to add in this section.

### Server RCON
- You need to enter the RCON information we need to connect to your Minecraft server in this section.
- Enable RCON by setting enable-rcon to true in server.properties. 
- If you do not enter any information in this section, server support will automatically switch off.
=== ":material-minecraft: RCON Information"
    1. **IP**: The IP address of your server.
    2. **Port**: The port for the RCON connection from rcon.port in server.properties. Set to 25575 by default.

## Ticket System

### <u>Ticket Systems</u>
There are 2 systems for tickets:

#### 1. Thread
- This is a new system that MineBot uses to open subheadings on a single channel.

#### 2. Category
- This system opens different channels on a category. This is an older system preferred by some networks. 

=== "Thread"
    ```yaml
    ticket_system: Thread
    ```
=== "Category"
    ```yaml
    ticket_system: Category
    ```

### <u>Opening Styles</u>
We have 2 opening styles:

#### Direct
- Does not send any information message to the channel you set as the main channel, you must either send this message yourself or write it in the channel description.
- Direct opening style can only be used in message and command opening methods and **is not** compatible with other systems.

#### Post Message
- It sends an embed information message to the channel you set as the main channel. Thus, you do not need to send any information message.
- Post Message opening style is compatible with **all opening methods**.

    opening:
      style: Direct
    ```

### <u>Opening Methods</u>

#### Message
- This opening method creates a ticket channel when a message arrives in the channel you specified for the ticket category.
- Assigns the message it receives as an embed message into the ticket channel it opens.

#### Reaction
- This opening method is triggered when there is a reaction to the information message on the channel you set as the main channel.
- Different emojis can be defined for all ticket categories you specify.
- Also receives information about the ticket content from the user via a form.

#### Button

- It is possible to assign different buttons for each ticket category.
- Each button has an emoji and text that can be determined for itself.
- It receives information messages for Ticket from the user via the form.

#### Dropdown
