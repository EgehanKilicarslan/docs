# MineAcademy Minebot Documentation - Luxury Futuristic Design

## Overview
Creating an ultra-modern, luxurious documentation site for MineAcademy.org's Minebot Discord integration. The design will incorporate predicted design trends for 2026-2030, with seamless dark/light mode transitions and a focus on premium user experience.

## Core Design Principles (2026-2030 Predictions)
- Neumorphic-Holographic UI elements: Subtle 3D elements with holographic accents
- Adaptive Typography: Dynamic, responsive text that adjusts based on content importance
- Micro-interactions: Subtle animations that respond to user actions
- Spatial Design: Using depth and layering to create hierarchy
- Ambient Color Theory: Colors that shift based on content context and mode
- Bio-inspired Design Elements: Organic shapes and patterns
- Sustainable Design Aesthetics: Clean, minimal yet luxurious interfaces
- Crystalline Transparency Effects: Sophisticated glass-like components with depth
- No animations
- Looks great on both dark and white theme

## Content Structure
- Homepage: Stunning hero section with immersive Minecraft/Discord integration visuals
- Documentation Pages:
  1. "Installation": Step-by-step guide to install Minebot
  2. "Running": Instructions on how to run and maintain Minebot
  3. "Configuration": Comprehensive guide to configure and customize Minebot
  4. "Localization": How to adapt Minebot for different languages and regional settings
